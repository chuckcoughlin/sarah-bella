# Command the robot to change its current vector. The reason that we use
# a service instead of simply publishing a twist message is that the
# remote always starts after the robot is running. The subscriber cannot 
# be started before the publisher.
#
# We only care about the straight ahead velocity (x) and rotation on the plane (z).
# Updates are nominally every 100ms, Log every 2 seconds.
#
# Package: teleop. Define the Twist message as a command.
