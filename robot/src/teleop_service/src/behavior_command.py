# Command the robot to change its current application. These applications are
# all lidar-related.  We use a service instead of simply publishing a message 
# because the # remote always starts after the robot is running. The subscriber cannot 
# be started before the publisher.
#
# We always respond to requests with no regard to the current behavior. If the 
# robot is given a behavior, like say "park", then it is up to the controller
# to suppress joystick commands (if appropriate). Likewise, we leave it to the
# tablet controller to pay attention to obstacle alerts.
#
# Use this method to open the teleop status publisher as a guarantee that
# the topic will always exist. The various behaviors all make use of it.
#
# Package: teleop_service. Define the behavior.
