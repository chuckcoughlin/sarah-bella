# Extensions to Core Configuration

This document summarizes hardware, software and configuration extensions to support specific applications on the Sarah-Bella application.
Refer to [applications](http://github.com/chuckcoughlin/sarah-bella/tree/master/docs/applications.md) for general descriptions.

We have drawn heavily from common message definitions that are available from the repository: https://github.com/ros/common_msgs. We pick and choose from
the collection as needed.

*********************************************************
### 00 - Discovery <a id="discovery"></a>
Discovery makes use of the following robot parameters. These are
 expected to be defined/published in every robot launch script:

* robot/name  - the name of the robot
* robot/type  - the robot type (e.g. turtlebot3)
* robot/platform - the hardware platform (e.g. Linux, RaspberryPi)
* robot/application - the name of the application currently running on the robot

Application selection and restart of the robot depends on a *ssh* login as super-user and execution of the following commands:
```
  ~/robotics/robot/bin/set_ros_application <app_name>
  /etc/init.d/ros restart
```


### 01 - System Check <a id="systemcheck"></a>

*psutil* is used on the robot to obtain system performance metrics in support of the custom *System* message type. This package is installed by default on the Linux virtual machine, but not on the
Raspberry Pi. For a complete description see [here](https://psutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest). To install on the robot:
```
   sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-pip
   sudo pip install psutil
```

```
System
      String hostname
      String ip_address
      Float32 cpu_percent
      Float32 memory_percent_used
      Uint32 free_memory_bytes
      Float32 swap_memory_percent_used
      Float32 disk_percent_used
      Uint32 packets_sent
      Uint32 packets_received
      Uint32 in_packets_dropped
      Uint32 out_packets_dropped
```
The *BatteryState* message is from sensor_msgs in the common message bundle. For a full description, see
[here](http://docs.ros.org/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/BatteryState.html). The message below lists the subset
of attributes that are actually implemented.

NOTE: the current code for BatteryState
is appropriate for a MAX17043 LIPO Fuel Gauge which is not currently wired.

```
BatteryState
  Float32 voltage          # Voltage in Volts (Mandatory)
  Float32 percentage       # Charge percentage on 0 to 1 range  (If unmeasured NaN)
  Bool    present          # True if the battery is present
```

The *GPIOState* message is a custom message that provides the current state and configuration of the GPIO board on the Raspberry Pi.
It consists of a list of 40 *GPIOPin* messages (named pin1,,,pin40) one for each physical pin on the GPIO header. Each pin sub-message consists of:

```
GPIOPin
  String name
  Uint32 channel
  Bool value
  String mode              # IN, OUT, GND, PWR
```
The panel subscribes to the following topics:
 * /gpio_msgsGPIOState
 * /gpio_msgs/GPIOPin
 * /sb_system/System
 * /std_msgs/BatteryState
 
The *GPIOState* is infrequent (20 secs) and provides a view of the entire state and configuration of the board. The *GPIOPin* message reports changes of individual
pin states asynchronously.

The panel is provides control of GPIO values with the action:
 * /gpio_msgs/GPIOPin

The initial construction of the package files was accomplished using:
```
    catkin_create_pkg system_check rospy turtlebot3_msgs  turtlebot3_navigation
```

### 02 - Follow <a id="follow"></a>
 The *follower* application is one of the ROBOTIS demonstrations from: https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_applications.git. Find documentation (here)[http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/applications]. It requires scikit-learn, NumPy and SciPy python packages. To install:
 ```
    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo pip install -U scikit-learn numpy scipy
    sudo pip install --upgrade pip

 ```

 The *follow* application will cause the TurtleBot3 to look for objects in a window 50cm in front of it. And it will seek to keep the centroid of the observed objects directly in front of it and a fixed distance away. If the centroid of the object is too far away it will drive forward, too close backward, and if offset to the side it will turn toward the centroid.
