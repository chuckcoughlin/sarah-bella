# Scenario Descriptions

The robot repertoire consists of a set of separate activities, each independent of the others. Each activity requires a separate build
on the development virtual machine, and a separate SD card image for the Raspberry Pi on the robot. 

The android assistant, on the other hand, contains control and monitoring code for all scenarios. 

### 01 - Hardware Check
This activity attempts to excercize all of the devices on the robot.
